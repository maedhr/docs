## Introduction

This doc describes the Dark language. Dark is really a system - a
combination of the language, editor, framework and infrastructure. In this
doc, we'll focus on discussing the language itself, ignoring where possible
the editor and infrastructure.

This discusses both the language and the **intended** language. We have taken
many shortcuts to be able to ship Dark, and so many parts of the language are
not currently at their end state. Here we discuss both what the language is,
and what we intend it to be.

Dark is a statically-typed functional/imperative hybrid, based loosely on ML.
It is a high-level language, with immutable values, garbage
collection, and support for generics/polymorphic types.

Dark is somewhat similar to OCaml or Elm. It has many similarities to Rust and
Haskell, and is also influenced by Clojure, Ruby, Python, Coffeescript, as well
as our experience with (alphabetically) Bash, C, Clojure, Coffeescript, C++,
Elm, Javascript, Java, Haskell, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, ReasonML, Ruby/Rails,
React, and Rust.

### Type system

Dark’s type system is most similar to Elm, Haskell, ReasonML, OCaml or Rust:
based on records, enums, list, and built-in generics/polymorphism. All
values in Dark are immutable, except refs.

Dark has some standard basic types: `int`, `string`, `boolean`, `float`, `list`, and
`dicts`.

We support typical functional types: `Option` and `Result`.

Currently, Dark has a `null` type to support JSON values directly. In the
future, we intend to deprecate `null` and replace it with `Options`.

## Built-in types

### Integers

Integers are signed 63-bit integer.

In the future, Dark will use infinite-precision integers. We also intend to add
unsigned 8-bit integers and bit-manipulation functions.

### Floats

Floats are double-precision 64-bit floating-point values (IEEE 754).

We intend for numberic operations to return Results, to handle situations which
are undefined on the datatype. For example, integer division would return
`Result Error Int`. Similarly, floating point values would never be NaaN, and
instead would return a NaN return `Result Error Float`. See
[Error Handling in Dark](error-handling) for more.

### Booleans

Booleans are true or false.

### Strings

Strings are unicode, and character are unicode “characters” (if it appears as
one character on the screen, that’s a “character” in Dark).

Specifically, string are immutable utf-8 encoded sequences of Unicode code
points. Chars are “Extended Grapheme Clusters”. (A codepoint is some bytes that
implement unicode characters, a grapheme is some codepoints forming a unicode
entity, such as an emoji; an EGC is some graphemes, used to handle things like
emojis which combine to form a single emoji).

Dark doesn't currently support string interpolation, but we plan to in the
future.

### Characters

In the future, Dark will support individual characters.

### Lists/Arrays

Lists and Arrays use the same datatype, called Lists. The Dark compiler will in
the future optimize their implementation to support good algorithmic complexity
and performance for whatever you use them for.

Lists should be used for all “I want a sequence of things” situations,
including iterating across them, random access, push/pop, etc.

```elm
let x = [8]
let y = x ++ [6]
y
```

```elm
[8, 6]
```

### Binary

Non-unicode sequences of bytes are supported as the `Binary` type.

### Options

Instead of allowing all values to potentially be null, as in most imperative languages, Dark uses an Option type:

```elm
Option a = Just a | Nothing
```

This is intended to convert effortlessly to null in JSON, but we don't quite
have enough type-system support for that yet.

Functions which return `Option` trigger the [Errorrail](error-handling).

### Results

Any functions which can have an error should use Results. We use results for Int division, Float operations, HTTP operations, etc.

```elm
Result a = Ok a | Err Error
```

Dark has no exceptions - all errors go through Results. See [error handling](error-handling) for more details.

### Dicts

Dicts are maps from a certain key type to a certain value type. The key must
currently be a string.  The value can be any type but all elements of the Dict
are the same type (not currently enforced).

Dicts are different than records: dicts can have arbitrary keys.

### UUID

Dark supports UUIDs directly.

### Null

As a temporary hack, Dark also supports `null`. This allows us handle JSON
while we build out enough type-system support to make get rid of `null`.

Null is mostly useful for comparing against incoming JSON and results of
HTTPClient calls. When returning JSON or making HTTPClient calls, you can use
Options instead and they will be converted properly to `null` in the JSON
output.

## User defined types

Dark currently has limited support for user-defined types. Currently, we
support inline definition of records, but do not support defining record types
explicitly.

Record types are actually implemented under the hood, and we intend to use them
to support typed Datastores, API contracts, and static types.

Dark does not currently support user-defined enums.

User-defined types will be either recrods or enums, or combinations of other type expressions.

Types in Dark are out-of-line, meaning that they are not defined “on the
canvas”, in a similar way to functions.

All types in Dark will be versioned.

In the future, we intend to support typeclasses or traits to allow ad-hoc polymorphism.

### Records

Records are a set of keys and values. Each key name and type are defined, and
the types do not have to be the same.

```elm
let x = { name: "Robin"
          age: 32
          gender: "Other"
        }
```

Records can not be accessed dynamically; they are not Maps/Hashtables/Dicts.

Records are structurally typed, and are equivalent to records of the same shape
but a different name.

Note that at the moment, Dicts and Records share the same implementation and
can be accessed and modified in the same way. We intend to break these apart in
the future.

### Enums

Enums are a set of “constructors”, each of which has a set of typed arguments.

Currently, Dark only supports `Option` and `Result` built-in enums. In the
future, we will support user-defined enums.

```elm
type Person = Human {age: Int, name: String, itin: String }
            | Corporation {age: Int, name: String, ein: String }
            | Puppers Int String
```

Enums can be made by building on existing types, especially records and other enums.

Enums are nominally typed. (Two enums with the same fieldnames and types are not equivalent).

## Types unique to Dark

### Incompletes

Programs in Dark start as a single empty expression. As they get built up in
our structured editor, they can never become syntactically invalid. However, a
program may be incomplete if any its expressions are empty.

An empty expression is incomplete. A developer may write programs where some
parts are incomplete as they build out the code. As such, incomplete values
appear dynamically when the code is executed. Structures containing incompletes
are themselves incomplete. For example functions with incomplete arguments do
not execute, and return incomplete; and records with an incomplete field are
also incomplete.

Incompletes are never returned to end users, and cannot be stored in a
datastore. Returning an incomplete via a HTTP handler causes a 500 error.

### ErrorRail

You might occasionally see a value marked `<ErrorRail>`, this is used to indicate that a value is on the Error Rail. See [railway oriented programming for more details]

### Sensitive Types

Some values are sensitive, for example, passwords or credit card numbers.

Currently Dark supports the `Password` type, which is never saved directly or
sent to the editor.

In the future, Dark will allow you to specify types of sensitive values,
preventing them from being stored in logs, and allowing a team to limit who has
access to these values in the Dark editor.

## Expressions

All Dark language constructs are expressions. That means that they evaluate to
a value, rather than being used to set state.

### Let

Lets creates a name with an immutable value, and a scope in which that is defined.

```elm
let name = "Stella"
name
```

We often refer to these names as variables, for simplicy. However, they never
vary: once they are defined, they never have any other value.

#### Variable Scope

```elm
if age > 18
then
  let height = 170
  height + 12
else
  let weight = 105
  weight / 2
```

In the example above, the scope of `height` and `weight` only extends to within
the `then` block and `else` block respectively. You cannot use either variable
below the `if` expression.

See doc on `coding in an expression-based language`.

### Conditionals

Dark supports if/else statement. The argument to an `if` is a boolean. We
currently support `truthy` types but intend to remove that ability.

We support `&&` and `||` - they do not currently short-circuit but we intend them to in the future.

An `if` is not currently allowed without a corresponding `else` - we will relax
this after we introduce statements.

### Match expressions

Dark supports pattern matching, in particular, matching on `Enum`s.

```elm
let introduction =
  match name with
  | Nothing -> "Hi!"
  | Just name -> "Dear " ++ name
```

We expect to allow guards in the future. We also hope to add an `if-let`
construct to support `if` statements that destructure from Enums.

### Functions

Functions must have type declarations for inputs. We intend to support types on return values soon.

```elm
fetch url name =
  { url: url
  , name: name
  }
```

Functions in Dark are simple, and do not currently support functional language
concepts, such as partial application, functions as first-class values, and
defining functions in using points-free style.

Functions do not live in the “Canvas”, but rather are a little bit ethereal.

In the future, we intend to support partial application/currying, and
default/optional parameters.

### Lambdas

Lambdas are anonymous functions. They are used to pass to functions which take
`Block`s, typically used for iteration.

```elm
List::map [5, 10, 11] \var -> var + 2
```

```elm
[7, 12, 13]
```

In the future, we intend to support a syntax for shorthands for creating
lambdas to access fields: `.fieldname`. This can be included in a pipe or used
as a first class function.

We also intend to support passing functions where blocks are expected.

There is a syntax for shorthands for creating lambda’s to call constructors:
`ConstructorName`. This can be included in a pipe or used as a first class
function.

### Pipelining

Dark programs are intended to be written, as much as possible, as pipelines of data:

```elm
user
|> getFriends
|> List.map (\f -> (f, getFriends f))
|> List.filter (\f -> f.name == "Kevin Bacon")
|> (=) []
```

### Feature Flags

Feature flags are similar to `if`s:

```elm
flag myCondition
then 5
else 6
```

However, flags differ slightly from ifs in that any condition that is not
`true` will cause the `then` block to activate. This is especially important
around `incomplete`s, allowing you to take working code and edit the feature flag
without disturbing existing users. In an `if` statement, neither branch would
execute.

## Planned language features

### Tuples

Dark intends to support tuples: lists of defined length supporting heterogeneous types.

```elm
x = (1, "string", { name: "Sam" })
```

### Sets

We intend for Dark to support Sets: unordered collections of a single type.

### Unit

We intend to support the unit type, which indicates something that have no type, such as an imperative function that doesn't return anything.

```elm
x = ()
```

### Imperative programming (Statements and refs)

It is intended that you write the program as you think it, not to shoehorn your
program into a functional style. As such, Dark is planning to add a number of
imperative concepts to allow you to easily write imperative algorithms,
including statements, refs, and mutable data structures.
